To get a nicely formatted git history ``git log`` can be used in the terminal.
Just think about a dog, to remember the option for generating a readable graph.

You can generate an alias for easier use:
```bash
git config --global alias.dog "log --all --decorate --oneline --graph"
git dog
```

From the ``git log --help``:

``--all``
> Pretend as if all the refs in refs/, along with HEAD, are listed on the command line as <commit>.

``--no-decorate, --decorate[=short|full|auto|no]``
> Print out the ref names of any commits that are shown. If short is specified, the ref name prefixes
> refs/heads/, refs/tags/ and refs/remotes/ will not be printed. If full is specified, the full ref name
> (including prefix) will be printed. If auto is specified, then if the output is going to a terminal, the ref
> names are shown as if short were given, otherwise no ref names are shown. The default option is short.

``--oneline``
> This is a shorthand for "--pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit" used together.

``--graph``
> Draw a text-based graphical representation of the commit history on the left hand side of the output. This
> may cause extra lines to be printed in between commits, in order for the graph history to be drawn properly.
> Cannot be combined with --no-walk.
> This enables parent rewriting, see History Simplification above.
> This implies the --topo-order option by default, but the --date-order option may also be specified.
