[JC](https://github.com/kellyjonbrazil/jc) is a Python tool for converting Linux command output to JSON. JC contains many parsers for Linux tools to "JSONify" their output. This can simplify scripts and there is even an [Ansible filter](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/general/jc_filter.html#ansible-collections-community-general-jc-filter) available.
